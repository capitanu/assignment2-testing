<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project assignment was implemented by Group 23 for the <a href="https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2480?l=en">DD2480 Software Engineering Fundamentals</a> course at <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a>.

It consists of implementing part of a hypothetical anti-ballistic missile system which should determine whether an interceptor missile should be launch based upon radar tracking information.

`DECIDE()` determines which combination of the several possible Launch Interceptor Conditions (`LIC`’s) are relevant to the immediate situation. The interceptor launch button is normally considered locked; only if all relevant combinations of launch conditions are met will the launch-unlock signal be issued.

## Contributions

For this assignment, Calin Capitanu organically took the role of leader. 
He set up the repository with the code skeleton and the right dependencies. 
He also added a code linter/formatter, a GitHub workflow for automatic testing and a `Makefile` to help with building.

After this we had a meeting where we broke the project down into tasks and opened an issue for each one of them.
Then everyone asynchronously implemented and tested their features with others reviewing the pull requests, 
and we occasionally helped each other on specific issues.

After having completed the main part of the project, Calin Capitanu wrote a Python script to randomize integration test inputs,
Per Arn documented our way of working in `Essence-our_way_of_working.pdf`, and Kamil Mellouk wrote this `README.md`
